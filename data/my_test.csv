"One of the more fascinating cases of a structural form of judicialization relates to that of C Nimitz letter of defense during K Doenitz Nuremberg trial This is a singular source however it very much encapsulates the beginnings of what today is understood as judicialization In summary C Nimitz held command of all unrestricted submarine warfare during WWII for the allies He would go on to write a neutralnon apologetic letter describing the use of this during KDoenitz war crime trial The Kriegsmarine whom Doenitz had commanded during WWII conducted the same actions This is notable as it highlights a trend throughout the Cold War in which members of various militaries in a surprising number of cases might find another source to confirm this theory controlled courts and provided legal expertise something the vast majority of persons were incapable of giving Particularly strong cases exist in states that had judiciaries rebuilt from scratch Germany and Japan are good examples as well as smaller instances unique to the postwar period However these studies or cases offer no more than a structural approach to their respective theoretical analysis A gap thus in the majority of the theoretical views on the origins of international judicialization present in Ferejohn 2002 ChienChih 2016 and Rehders 2007 articles all note the structural focussed arguments 
Legal and Political Reforms in the Aftermath of WWII
In the wake of WWII the establishment of the United Nations UN and the implementation of international human rights laws were crucial in shaping the role of legal institutions The creation of the International Court of Justice ICJ and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 marked pivotal moments in the global legal landscape However the most significant change was the increased emphasis on constitutionalism particularly in newly independent states which sought to safeguard democratic ideals through robust legal frameworks
The judicialization of politics took root in this context Courts as impartial arbiters were increasingly seen as essential to the protection of human rights and the promotion of democratic governance As time passed and newly democraticindependent nations navigated their newfound autonomy their respective legal systems began incorporating judicial review as a fundamental tool for political accountability
Judicial Review and Its Role in PostWar Democracies
Judicial review the practice of courts evaluating the constitutionality of laws and actions by the executive and legislative branches was widely institutionalized during this period In countries such as the United States where judicial review had been a staple since the Marbury v Madison decision of 1803 its use in postWWII emerging democracies became more widespread The concept of judicializing politics or the process of courts becoming more involved in political decisionmaking emerged as a response to the increasing need for legal intervention in areas previously dominated by the political branches
Emerging powers keen on developing new political systems adopted judicial review as a mechanism to safeguard individual rights and constitutional integrity thereby facilitating the judicialization process This trend was especially evident in countries like Taiwan where the judicialization of politics was a tool for ensuring the rights of its citizens amidst complex political and social transformations
To fully comprehend the significance of judicialization in postWWII emerging powers we must examine its theoretical foundations Theories of judicialization particularly those developed in the field of political science and law explore the growing role of courts in resolving political disputes shaping public policy and ensuring democratic principles Ferejohn 2002 offers crucial insights into how the growing power of courts shifts political dynamics Ferejohn argues that the increasing judicialization of politics is a doubleedged sword On the one hand courts act as safeguards for the constitution and protect individual rights against potential political overreach On the other hand this increased judicial involvement may politicize the judiciary itself as courts become entangled in political battles undermining their role as neutral arbiters This tension between judicial neutrality and political engagement is central to understanding the evolution of judicialization in postWWII emerging powers As legal institutions took on more prominent roles in politics they were often accused of overstepping their bounds interfering in the prerogatives of elected representatives and shaping policy outcomes that should have been determined by the political branches Political Influence on and Structuralist theories The judicialization of politics in Taiwan offers a particularly interesting example of how emerging powers integrated judicial review into their legal systems ChienChihs article 2016 explores Taiwans constitutional development in the postWWII era Taiwan initially under martial law underwent significant political reform in the 1980s and 1990s shifting from an authoritarian regime to a democratic society and  argues that Taiwans transition was marked by the increasing involvement of courts in political disputes particularly concerning electoral laws and human rights protections As the country moved toward democracy the judicialization of politics became an important feature of its legal culture with courts playing an instrumental role in resolving conflicts between the executive and legislature
Britta Rehders work What is Political About Jurisprudence Courts Politics and Political Science in Europe and the United States 2007 examines the role of courts in political life within both European and American contexts Rehder highlights that in Europe courts have often been seen as politically neutral entities that uphold the rule of law but this neutrality has been increasingly challenged In particular the rise of the European Court of Justice ECJ and the influence of the European Union EU in member states domestic legal systems illustrate how judicial bodies have come to play pivotal roles in national political affairs This theoretical shift is particularly important when analyzing the relationship between emerging powers and judicialization While European courts may have historically maintained more conservative roles emerging powers often view their judicial institutions as essential to the consolidation of democratic values and human rights protections One of the primary strengths of judicialization is its ability to protect individual rights and uphold democratic principles In countries like Taiwan where democratic institutions were initially weak courts acted as crucial checks on the executive and legislative branches ensuring that political power did not undermine the rule of law The judicialization process allowed courts to play a vital role in institutionalizing human rights protections democratic accountability and the separation of powers Additionally judicial review has been instrumental in ensuring that emerging powers remain compliant with international law and human rights standards By integrating judicial review into their legal systems emerging powers were able to align their domestic legal practices with international norms fostering cooperation with global governance structures like the United Nations However judicialization also comes with notable weaknesses As Ferejohn notes there is a risk that increased judicial involvement in politics may undermine the legitimacy of both courts and political institutions When courts are perceived as overstepping their bounds or taking sides in political disputes it can erode public trust in the judiciarys neutrality This is particularly problematic in emerging powers where democratic institutions are still in development and any loss of confidence in the judiciary can have profound political consequences Moreover judicialization may lead to the politicization of the judiciary itself In countries like Taiwan where political polarization is strong the judiciary can become a battleground for competing political ideologies undermining its role as a neutral adjudicator of legal disputes While judicialization in emerging powers postWWII shares common elements it is important to compare these developments with other global contexts In Europe for instance judicialization has been more gradual and embedded within democratic institutions In contrast in emerging powers judicialization often emerged as a response to the lack of democratic checks and balances making it a more contentious process Understanding these differences helps contextualize the broader implications of judicialization in global politics The sources analyzed in this structuralist approach such as Ferejohns 2002 and s in Taiwan provide important insights into how emerging powers have shaped the judicialization process These works highlight the tension between legal protection of rights and the potential for judicial overreach Furthermore Rehders exploration of political jurisprudence offers a comparative perspective showing how judicialization in Europe and the United States differs from trends in emerging powers The judicialization of politics in emerging powers postWWII represents a significant shift in global political dynamics As courts increasingly take on political roles they have the potential to safeguard democratic values and human rights but also to politicize the legal process The theoretical implications of this development suggest that judicialization is both a necessary and fraught process particularly in emerging democracies By critically evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of judicialization we gain a deeper understanding of its role in shaping the modern era of governance The analysis of key sources further enriches this discussion revealing the complexities and challenges that come with judicialization in different political contexts Ultimately judicialization reflects both the aspirations and tensions of postWWII emerging powers as they navigate the delicate balance between law politics and democracy",0
